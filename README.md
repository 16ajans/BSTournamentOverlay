Hi I made this and Flee helped me a lot yay
~~Only works on TA version 0.5.9 and below (not compatiable with newer versions because protobuf)
You can see it working in action here:

TA integration removed.
Roster site syncing removed - hardcoded teams & map pools.
QOL controller buttons added.
Map pool limit upgraded to 12, dynamically arranged.
Padding adjusted, most views stripped out/not updated for new state management.
